🤾‍♀️ The "Olympic Games 2024 Insights Dashboard" aims to deliver actionable insights and a comprehensive overview of the Games. It serves as a valuable tool for sports analysts, journalists, fans, and researchers to track performance, analyze trends, and engage with the event on a deeper level. By leveraging Power BI’s robust analytics capabilities, this project ensures that users have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information at their fingertips. 🤾‍♀️

## 🚀 Exciting Project Alert! 🚀

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, where I dove deep into the Food & Beverage Market to uncover valuable insights using Power BI. 📊

🌟 Project Highlights:

💠 Analyzed a survey of 10,000 respondents across 10 Indian cities for CodeX, a leading German beverage company entering the Indian market.

💠 Visualized data to reveal key trends and preferences in the industry, aiding CodeX in making data-driven decisions for their product launch.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my data analysis and visualization skills to a real-world challenge, helping a global brand succeed in a new market🌍
